&gt;&gt; Mrs. Trump: My fellow Americans,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.670 line:20%
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as First Lady of the United States.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.840 line:20%
I have been inspired by incredible Americans across our country who lift up our communities

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.670 line:20%
through their kindness and courage, goodness and grace.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.510 line:20%
The past four years have been unforgettable.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.840 line:20%
As Donald and I conclude our time in the White House,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.120 line:20%
I think of all the people I have taken home in my heart and their incredible stories of love,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.130 line:20%
patriotism, and determination.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.110 line:20%
I see the faces of brave young soldiers who have told me with pride in their eyes

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.790 line:20%
how much they love serving this country.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.350 line:20%
To every service member and to our incredible military families:

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.760 line:20%
You are heroes, and you will always be in my thoughts and prayers.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:09.640 line:20%
I think of all the members of law enforcement who greet us wherever we go. At every hour of every day,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.240 line:20%
they stand guard to keep our communities safe,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.949 line:20%
and we are forever in their debt.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.940 line:20%
I have been moved by children I have visited in hospitals and foster care centers.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.430 line:20%
Even as they fight difficult illnesses or face challenges,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.920 line:20%
they bring such a joy to everyone they meet.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.110 line:20%
I remember the mothers who have battled the disease of Opioid addiction and have overcome incredible hardships

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.710 line:20%
for love of their children.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.060 line:20%
I have been inspired by the devoted caregivers for babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.940 line:20%
and communities that give these children the support and care they need to grow.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.840 line:20%
When I think about these meaningful experiences, I am humbled to have had the opportunity

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.550 line:20%
to represent a nation with such kind and generous people.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.810 line:20%
As the world continues to confront the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.280 line:20%
I thank all the nurses, doctors, healthcare professionals, manufacturing workers, truck drivers,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.270 line:20%
and so many others who are working to save lives.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.680 line:20%
We grieve for the families who have lost a loved one due to the pandemic. Every life is precious,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.690 line:20%
and I ask all Americans to use caution and common sense to protect the vulnerable

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.040 line:20%
as millions of vaccines are now being delivered.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.939 line:20%
In the midst of this hardship, we have seen the best of America shine through.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.320 line:20%
Students have made cards and delivered groceries to our Senior Citizens.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.310 line:20%
Teachers have worked twice as hard to keep our children learning.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.720 line:20%
Families have come together to provide meals, supplies, comfort and friendship to those in need.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.110 line:20%
Be passionate in everything you do

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.060 line:20%
but always remember that violence is never the answer

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.370 line:20%
and will never be justified.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.750 line:20%
When I came to the White House, I reflected on the responsibility I have always felt as a mother to encourage,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.900 line:20%
give strength, and teach values of kindness.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:41.980 line:20%
It is our duty as adults and parents to ensure that children have the best opportunities to lead fulfilling and healthy lives.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.650 line:20%
The passion for helping children succeed

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.240 line:20%
has driven my policy initiatives as First Lady.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.770 line:20%
I launched Be Best to ensure that we as Americans are doing all we can to take care of the next generation.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.590 line:20%
Be Best has concentrated on three pillars:

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.120 line:20%
well-being, online safety, and opioid abuse.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.380 line:20%
In a few short years, I have raised awareness of how to keep children safe online;

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.820 line:20%
we have made incredible progress on our nation's drug epidemic

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.500 line:20%
and how it impacts the lives of newborns and families,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.960 line:20%
and we have given a voice to our most vulnerable children in the foster care system.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:41.650 line:20%
Internationally, Be Best has evolved into a platform that encourages world leaders to discuss issues

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.700 line:20%
impacting the lives of children

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.740 line:20%
and allows them to share solutions.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.250 line:20%
It has been an honor to represent the American people abroad.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.450 line:20%
I treasure each of my experiences and the inspiring people I have met along the way.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.440 line:20%
As I say farewell to my role as First Lady,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:13.100 line:20%
it is my sincere hope that every American will do their part to teach our children what it means to Be Best.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:22.820 line:20%
I encourage parents to educate your children about the courageous and selfless heroes who worked and sacrificed

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.480 line:20%
to make this country the land of the free.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.970 line:20%
And to lead by example and care for others in your community.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.540 line:20%
The promise of this Nation belongs to all of us.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.240 line:20%
Do not lose sight of your integrity and values.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.470 line:20%
Use every opportunity to show consideration for another person

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.980 line:20%
and build good habits into your daily lives.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.020 line:20%
In all circumstances, I ask every American to be an ambassador of Be Best.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.290 line:20%
To focus on what unites us. To rise above what divides us.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.980 line:20%
To always choose love over hatred,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.080 line:20%
peace over violence, and others before yourself.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.750 line:20%
Together, as one national family,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.160 line:20%
we can continue to be the light of hope for future generations

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:27.020 line:20%
and carry on America's legacy of raising our nation to greater heights through our spirit of courage, goodness and faith.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.660 line:20%
No words can express the depth of my gratitude

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.700 line:20%
for the privilege of having served as your First Lady.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.830 line:20%
To all the people of this country:

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.230 line:20%
You will be in my heart forever.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.330 line:20%
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
