The President: To every family across our nation, the First Lady and I want to wish you all a very, very merry Christmas.

00:00:08.041 -to 00:00:13.580 
For Christians, this is a joyous time to remember God's greatest gift to the world.

00:00:13.580 -to 00:00:24.491 
More than 2,000 years ago, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary. He said, do not be afraid. You have found favor with God.

00:00:24.491 -to 00:00:32.866 
The angel told her that she would give birth to a baby boy, Jesus, who would be called the son of the most high.

00:00:32.866 -to 00:00:41.241 
Nine months later, Christ was born in the town of Bethlehem. The son of God came into the world in a humble stable.

00:00:41.241 -to 00:00:48.014 
As Christians everywhere know, the birth of our lord and savior changed history forever.

00:00:48.014 -to 00:01:00.059 
At Christmas, we give thanks to God and that God sent his only son to die for us and to offer everlasting peace to all humanity.

00:01:00.059 -to 00:01:06.699 
More than two millennia after the birth of Jesus Christ, his teachings continue to inspire and

00:01:06.699 -to 00:01:14.874 
uplift billions and billions of people all over the globe. His divine word still fills our hearts with hope

00:01:14.874 -to 00:01:25.618 
and faith, and Christians everywhere still strive to live by Jesus's timeless commandment to his disciples: love one another.

00:01:27.687 -to 00:01:34.327 
This year, our nation and the world have battled a once in a century pandemic.

00:01:34.327 -to 00:01:41.334 
We have witnessed Christ's spirit of selflessness and compassion throughout our land, and we have seen

00:01:41.334 -to 00:01:49.676 
God's mercy and grace and the goodness of our fellow citizens. Brave doctors, nurses and first responders have

00:01:49.676 -to 00:01:58.151 
courageously risked their lives to save others. Workers have labored around the clock to produce and deliver lifesaving supplies

00:01:58.151 -to 00:02:06.659 
and critical aid. Faith communities have rallied to care for those in need. And Americans across our nation have made profound

00:02:06.659 -to 00:02:16.035 
sacrifices for their neighbors and for people all over the world. We are now just days away from delivering millions

00:02:16.035 -to 00:02:24.644 
of doses of a safe and effective vaccine that will soon end this pandemic and save millions of lives.

00:02:24.644 -to 00:02:31.050 
Tonight, we give thanks for all of the scientists, researchers, manufacturers, workers,

00:02:31.050 -to 00:02:40.026 
and service members who have worked tirelessly to make this breakthrough possible. It is truly a Christmas miracle.

00:02:40.026 -to 00:02:48.735 
One of the great achievements medically, they say, ever in history. At this special time of year, we also express our

00:02:48.735 -to 00:02:55.241 
gratitude for the many blessings we enjoy as Americans. Our hearts and prayers are with the brave members of

00:02:55.241 -to 00:03:02.315 
law enforcement who keep our communities safe. And we remember all of the heroes of the United

00:03:02.315 -to 00:03:12.091 
States military, especially those who are spending this holiday far from home. We send our love to each and every one of them.

00:03:12.091 -to 00:03:21.768 
They are very, very special people. Above all, during the sacred season, our souls are full of thanks and praise for Almighty God,

00:03:21.768 -to 00:03:30.209 
for sending us Christ, his son, to redeem the world. Tonight, we ask that God will continue to bless

00:03:30.209 -to 00:03:39.419 
this nation and we pray that he will grant every American family a Christmas season full of joy, hope and peace.

00:03:39.419 -to 00:03:47.927

00:03:47.927 -to 00:04:21.694
