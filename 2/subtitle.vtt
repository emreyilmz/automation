00:00:00.000 -to 00:00:11.444 
Robert O'Brien: Well, good afternoon, everyone. Good to be here with you. So four years ago, President Trump ran on a

00:00:11.444 -to 00:00:18.918 
promise to put a stop to America's endless wars. Today, it's just announced at the Pentagon President

00:00:18.918 -to 00:00:24.657 
Trump is keeping that promise to the American people. President Trump understood that the way to end those

00:00:24.657 -to 00:00:32.866 
wars was to adopt a peace through strength approach to the world. He rebuilt the American military, which had been

00:00:32.866 -to 00:00:40.940 
decimated by defense sequestration under the Obama administration. He required our allies to step up their game.

00:00:40.940 -to 00:00:46.813 
And America's NATO allies are now spending $400 billion in additional defense spending over the

00:00:46.813 -to 00:00:54.988 
next 10 years, and they've contributed more troops to conflict zones in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:54.988 -to 00:01:00.326 
I just finished a phone call with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of NATO, and we discussed

00:01:00.326 -to 00:01:08.568 
regional issues, and I thanked him for the alliance's continued contributions to the West's national security and to freedom and

00:01:08.568 -to 00:01:16.209 
security in our overseas missions in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. President Trump empowered our great armed forces to

00:01:16.209 -to 00:01:21.748 
defeat one hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. That caliphate was the size of Great Britain

00:01:21.748 -to 00:01:28.621 
stretching across Syria and Iraq when President Trump took office. And he authorized the daring nighttime raid that

00:01:28.621 -to 00:01:38.565 
brought justice to the founder and cruel leader of ISIS, Baqir Abu al-Baghdadi. Under President Trump, the U.S.

00:01:38.565 -to 00:01:43.570 
military and intelligence services have wiped out most of the al Qaeda leadership, striking that

00:01:43.570 -to 00:01:51.578 
organization which perpetrated 9/11 in Mali, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, and other locales.

00:01:51.578 -to 00:01:56.082 
President Trump's resolve and America's strength has also led to peace in the Middle East.

00:01:56.082 -to 00:02:01.287 
From the historic Abraham Accords to the peace deal with the Taliban that has led the inter-Afghan

00:02:01.287 -to 00:02:08.461 
negotiations, the world is safer because of the Trump administration's policies. Moments ago, Acting Secretary of Defense

00:02:08.461 -to 00:02:18.338 
Miller announced major troop reductions in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Effective January 15, 2021, American troops in

00:02:18.338 -to 00:02:25.612 
both countries will go to 2,500 personnel. Those troops will defend our embassies and the other agencies of the U.S.

00:02:25.612 -to 00:02:31.317 
government doing important work in those countries. They'll enable our American allies and their

00:02:31.317 -to 00:02:38.124 
important missions in those countries. They'll defend our diplomats, and they'll deter our foes.

00:02:38.124 -to 00:02:44.130 
By May, it is President Trump's hope that they will all come home safely and in their entirety.

00:02:44.130 -to 00:02:48.101 
I want to reiterate that this policy is not new. This has been the President's policy since

00:02:48.101 -to 00:02:53.039 
he took office, and it's a policy that I talked about specifically with these numbers at the University

00:02:53.039 -to 00:03:00.580 
of Las Vegas, University of Nevada, Las Vegas in October. So it's appropriate at this time to again thank

00:03:00.580 -to 00:03:05.585 
our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen and especially their families and

00:03:05.585 -to 00:03:12.725 
especially those families of our fallen heroes and of our wounded warriors. They have made tremendous sacrifices for the fight

00:03:12.725 -to 00:03:19.532 
against terrorism and to keep our country secure. They are simply the best men and women this country has to offer.

00:03:19.532 -to 00:03:24.637 
Critics have said that the President would not be able to rebuild our military, strengthen our

00:03:24.637 -to 00:03:31.578 
alliances, wreak havoc on the terrorists, bring peace to the Middle East, and end our forever wars.

00:03:31.578 -to 00:03:38.685 
Yet he has done that and positioned us to win the coming great power competition. Any one of these achievements would merit

00:03:38.685 -to 00:03:45.558 
tremendous praise. Taken together, President Trump's foreign policy and national security record is comparable only to

00:03:45.558 -to 00:03:53.566 
Ronald Reagan in the past two generations. Thank you all. God bless our men and women in uniform, and God bless this great nation.

00:03:53.566 -to 00:03:54.500 
Thank you very much.
