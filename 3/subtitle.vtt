00:00:00.000 -to 00:00:06.239 
The President: Hello, everybody. We'll be making three big stops -- three rally stops.

00:00:06.239 -to 00:00:13.179 
I understand that they've been camped out for a couple of days already, and we have a lot of people -- thousands and thousands.

00:00:13.179 -to 00:00:20.153 
I want to just tell you how happy everybody is, including me, with Justice Barrett.

00:00:20.153 -to 00:00:30.630 
She is going to be a great justice for many, many years. And I'm very proud of the way she -- she went through that process.

00:00:30.630 -to 00:00:37.303 
That was an incredible process. It was a tough process, but she got through it very easily, and we're very proud of the fact

00:00:37.303 -to 00:00:44.477 
that she is now a justice of the Supreme Court. The Press: Do you want to react to what President Obama said in his speech?

00:00:44.477 -to 00:00:52.852 
The President: I only saw he was on Fox. And Fox puts him on all the time, and they put Sleepy Joe on all the time.

00:00:52.852 -to 00:00:59.359 
And what they should do is they should show the picture of Sleepy Joe yesterday, when he rushed

00:00:59.359 -to 00:01:08.768 
to Pennsylvania because he saw that I had 25,000 people at each event. When he rushed to Pennsylvania and he did a

00:01:08.768 -to 00:01:18.044 
statement and he got lost in a fog, they should show that. Okay? Or they should show the picture where he called me "George."

00:01:18.044 -to 00:01:25.185 
He thought I was George. I guess, he's talking about George Bush. But he thought I was George, and they should show that.

00:01:25.185 -to 00:01:32.592 
No, Fox -- Fox is very disappointing. That Fox puts on this -- this would not have happened with Roger Ailes, I can tell you that.

00:01:32.592 -to 00:01:37.764 
Go ahead. The Press: (inaudible) are you willing to still talk about stimulus (inaudible)?

00:01:37.764 -to 00:01:40.533 
The President: I'll always talk about it because our people should get it. The Press: After the election, though?

00:01:40.533 -to 00:01:46.873 
The President: Yeah. Our people should get it -- the stimulus. But Nancy Pelosi is only interested in bailing out

00:01:46.873 -to 00:01:56.616 
badly run, crime-ridden Democrat cities and states. That's all she's interested in. She's not interested in helping the people.

00:01:56.616 -to 00:02:01.120 
We'll -- after the election, we'll get the best stimulus package you've ever seen, because

00:02:01.120 -to 00:02:05.859 
I think we're going to take back the House because of her. I think you have a lot of congressmen and women --

00:02:05.859 -to 00:02:13.199 
Republican -- that are going to get elected. We'll take back the House. We'll hold the Senate. We'll hold the White House.

00:02:13.199 -to 00:02:18.304 
If you look at the polls that came out today and yesterday -- and I guess a lot had to do with the

00:02:18.304 -to 00:02:25.745 
debate or a lot had to do with the rallies. I don't know. But you take a look at the polls. Look at how we're doing in Wisconsin.

00:02:25.745 -to 00:02:31.284 
Look how we're doing in Iowa. Look how we're doing in Ohio. Look how we're doing in Florida.

00:02:31.284 -to 00:02:37.357 
Look how we're doing everywhere, practically. So I think we're doing very well. We're going to have an exciting night.

00:02:37.357 -to 00:02:43.930 
It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3rd, instead of

00:02:43.930 -to 00:02:52.338 
counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that that's by our laws. I don't believe that.

00:02:52.338 -to 00:02:57.577 
So we'll see what happens. The Press: Mr. President, shouldn't the voters judge you on COVID? And did you blow it?

00:02:57.577 -to 00:03:04.284 
The President: Voters are judging me on a lot of things, and one of the things we've done a really good job on is COVID.

00:03:04.284 -to 00:03:08.321 
We would have millions of people -- millions, right now -- we would have millions of people --

00:03:08.321 -to 00:03:11.958 
The Press: That's if you did nothing. The President: -- dead. Two million people.

00:03:11.958 -to 00:03:19.165 
They were projecting 2.2 [million] if we didn't do what we did. We did the ventilators and now we're doing all of the equipment.

00:03:19.165 -to 00:03:22.735 
But now we're doing vaccines, we're doing -- The Press: But isn't that if you did nothing?

00:03:22.735 -to 00:03:28.875 
The President: -- therapeutics, and we've done a great job. And people are starting to see. Now Biden had the swine flu.

00:03:28.875 -to 00:03:36.616 
He did the worst job that anybody has ever seen. Had no idea what he was doing. And his Chief of Staff said he had no idea what

00:03:36.616 -to 00:03:40.119 
he was doing. I'll see you in Michigan. We're going to have some fun. 100 00:03:40,119 Thank you.
